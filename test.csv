24,"{Monica} Im so sorry. Please, stop freaking out. {Chandler} Im not freaking out. {Chandler} Why would I be freaking out? {Chandler} A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday. {Monica} Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! {Monica} I mean, whats the harm in that? {Chandler} Right here! {Monica} Chandler, please dont think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel {Chandler} Phoebe and Rachel! {Chandler} So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way! {Monica} It was a mistake. Please dont take this to mean anything, because it doesnt. {Chandler} Okay. {Monica} Really? {Chandler} Yes, if it really doesnt mean anything, because you know that Im just not ready {Monica} I know!

"
25,"{Joey} Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project. {Chandler} Yknow sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, arent they? {Joey} Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Yknow? The only problem is, Carls acting is {Monica} The {Joey} Yeah, hes the reason I didnt get that big {Carl} Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake? {Joey} Pizza!! We like Pizza!!

29,"{Phoebe} Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! {Phoebe} Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. {Phoebe} Quarter. {Phoebe} Dime. {Phoebe} Lint? {Phoebe} Not interested in that. {Phoebe} What's this? {Phoebe} A Canadian coin? {Phoebe} Get outta here! {Phoebe} Whoa-whoa-whoa! {Phoebe} No drinks near the bucket! {Phoebe} Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! {Phoebe} And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! {Phoebe} Hi Bob! {Phoebe} I thought I told you to get outta here! {Bob} Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot. "
30,"{Monica} Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge! {Rachel} Have you ever seen so much crap? {Chandler} Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap {Joey} Check this out. Can I have this? "
31,"{Rachel} All right, well the place was closed. Ill just copy it later. {Joey} Or not. Uh, Rach, why dont you just move in with me? {Ross} Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey! {Joey} No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no Its okay, I mean Ilook Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursdays thing, but we dont have to do that! {Rachel} Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless youre thinking about Naked Wednesdays. {Joey} Thursdays clearly not good for ya, pick a day! "
32,"{Phoebe} I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so... {Ross} Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts. {Joey} No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team. {Ross} Come on, two on one. {Chandler} What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in! {Ross} What, now? {Joey} Yes, now is when you swoop! {Joey} You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! {Joey} You're like, like the anti-Paolo! {Chandler} My Catholic friend is right. {Chandler} She's distraught. {Chandler} You're there for her. {Chandler} You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! "
33,"{Chandler} Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five? {Phoebe} Does, um, anyone wanna see? {All} Nooo.. {All} Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out! {Rachel} It's worse than the thumb! {Chandler} Hey, this is so unfair! {Monica} Oh, why is it unfair? {Chandler} So I have a flaw! {Chandler} Big deal! {Chandler} Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? {Chandler} And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? {Chandler} And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? {Chandler} I mean, what the hell is that thing? {Chandler} ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this? {Joey} ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody? {Rachel} Well, I-I could live without it. {Joey} Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair? {Ross} Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing. {Joey} Oh,  ""you do, do you""? {Ross} You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly. {Rachel} ""Indeed there isn't""... I should really get back to work. {Phoebe} Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered. {Rachel} Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on. "
34,"{Monica} Pheebs, hows it going? {Phoebe} Im doing okay. I think its going well. Do you think theyre having fun? Am I talking to fast? {Monica} Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, its going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler. {Chandler} Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? {Chandler} Oh right, Coach Ruben. {Chandler} Do you know what Pheebs? {Chandler} When youre done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too. {Phoebe} Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies. {Chandler} See thats where I think that youre wrong. Weve been playing these babies man for man. we should really be playing a zone defense. {Monica} What do you mean? "
35,"{Chandler} I cant believe you came back. {Rachel} Dont say anything. {Rachel} I dont wanna speak, I dont wanna think. {Rachel} I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now. {Friend No. 2} Rachel! Rachel! {Rachel} What? {Friend No. 2} You missed the exit! {Rachel} Oh, sorry. {Friend No. 1} My God, what were you thinking about? {Rachel} Um,  Barry. {Her-Friends} Awwwww "

415,"{Rachel} Its a trifle. {Rachel} Its got all of these layers. {Rachel} First theres a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch. {Rachel} [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sautéed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like somethings wrong.] {Rachel} then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top! {Ross} It tastes like feet! {Joey} I like it. {Ross} Are you kidding? "
416,"{Ross} Okay, where in the hell did you get that?! {Monica} When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out. {Ross} That cup is mine! {Monica} No its not!

Thats exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman. {Pete} What? {Phoebe} Im just saying, this woman, I mean shes fictitious. No? {Pete} Why would you say that? {Phoebe} Cause youre still into Monica. {Phoebe} So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and... {Pete} Youre good. Youre good! {Phoebe} Yeah, no, Im fairly intuitive and psychic. Its a substantial gift. {Pete} Listen, can you promise me that you wont tell her though? {Phoebe} Absolutely, oh I promise.

See, that's why you're so great! {Roger} Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. {Roger} Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! {Roger} Define me! {Roger} Love me, I need love!
